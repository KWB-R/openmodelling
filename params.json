Usually, the modelling procedure (parameterisation, calibration, validation, scenario analysis) includes manual steps. \r\nFor example, models are often calibrated by changing parameter values manually using a trial-and-error method (e.g. [Anibas et al. 2009](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7289)). \r\nThis makes it challenging to document how the modelling software was used, which is a prerequisite for making the applied methodology transparent and thus the whole modelling process reproducible.\r\n\r\nAutomatisation by means of programming can improve the modelling process. Once a methodology is implemented in the form of program code it is inherently documented. The code can be run repeatedly and will always produce the same results given the same inputs.\r\n\r\nWe used R as programming language to automate the modelling workflow.\r\n\r\nDifferent models have been 'wrapped' by means of R packages ([Sonnenberg et al. 2014](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.1.2140.3683)): [Hantush (1967)](http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5102/support/sir2010-5102.pdf) equation (groundwater mounding beneath an infiltration basin), [VS2DI](http://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GW_Unsat/vs2di1.3/index.html) (groundwater flow, heat and solute transport), [WTAQ-2](http://water.usgs.gov/ogw/wtaq/) (well drawdown), [EPANET](http://www2.epa.gov/water-research/epanet) (pressurised pipe networks) and [Gompitz](http://doi.org/10.1080/15730620801939398) (sewer ageing). \r\n\r\nThese models can now be configured and run from within the R environment. This allows to use R's excellent functions for retrieving and preparing input data (e.g. monitoring, geographical data) as well as analysing and plotting simulation results and generating reports.\r\n\r\nModelling is described in the form of version controlled R scripts so that its methodology becomes transparent and modifications (e.g. error fixing) trackable. This leads to reproducible results which should be the basis for smart decision making.   \r\n\r\n#References\r\n\r\nAnibas, C.; Fleckenstein,J.H.; Volze, N.; Buis, K.; Verhoeven, R.; Meire, P.; Batelaan, O.
